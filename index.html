        <div class="subheading mb-5">Political Analyist</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Amina Hearns, but most people call me Amina Marie. I was born and raised in West Covina, California on July 18, 2001. I am working as a political analyst for the United States government and was allowed to become Secretary of State just this past month. My main responsibilities fall under: researching political subjects such as foreign relations and political ideologies, forecasting political and socio-economic trends, evaluating effects of policies nationally and globally, and among other political related issues.<br><br>

         I grew up in a predominately LatinX community as one of the only black families in the neighborhood and attended all schools with the same reflection. School has always been an important aspect of my life and I believe it's essentially critical for our younger generation. Being a part of Nogales High School's Class of 2019, I made it my duty to affirm that the administration believed that it was just as important. After becoming an Honors and AP/IB student, I became a member of the school site council and later Vice-Chairman. Students have faced numerous inequities and inequalities crafted by the administration, making it seem the only way you would ever make it in life was by a degree from University. That is a lie. The children of our education system are being pushed into life, many later drop out of and have no preparation for the real world. They know the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell, but don't know how to write a resume. They forced vocational courses and replaced them with advanced material associating it only with STEM; completely disregarding humanities, arts, and many other fine courses. This is absolute devastation to our youth and for our country. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the United States ranks #24 out of 71 countries in reading, #36 in math, and #28 in science. How can our nation, a first world country, have numbers like this, yet be the richest country in the world?<br><br>

        This is why I became a political analyst. Being a political analyst, I see not just trends according to treaties or negotiations with world leaders, but also the difference in education from across the world and apply methods I learn into the policies that will update our outdated education system. Over the years I have traveled across various countries whose education system advances more than our own. Singapore, South Korea, Norway, Finland, the United Kingdom, and Israel are integral parts in creating a new path for our prospering youth. Learning an abundance of cultures and attitudes, there is a way for America to reach the success of being in the top 10 of educated countries, and with the right direction and leadership, we can become #1. This website is used to monitor political and social trends within our nation and globe, reach out to communities to affirm information, and ultimately share numerous values, cultures, and ideas to help further our country in civil liberties, and our world as a unit, rather than inactive, unreliable sectors.
